# libraryLinkedData_namespaces
This repository centralizes common namespace definitions used in Library Linked Data Projects

# Overview
This repository contains a collection of namespace definitions commonly used in Library Linked Data Projects. These namespaces include standards such as Bibframe, Schema.org, DC Terms (Dublin Core Terms), and FOAF (Friend of a Friend). Namespaces play a crucial role in organizing and categorizing resources within a triplestore, enabling clearer semantics and better data management.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to centralize and document the namespaces utilized in our triplestore. By maintaining a clear record of these namespaces, we ensure consistency across projects and facilitate collaboration among team members.
